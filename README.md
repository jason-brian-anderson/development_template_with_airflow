# Project Name: Pipefitter

## Overview

Pipefitter is a comprehensive and easy-to-use framework for orchestrated batch data processing, designed to facilitate rapid development of machine learning models as pipelines from the start. The framework combines several powerful data processing tools, such as Airflow, PyTorch, MLOps, Jupyter, and VSCode integration, in an orchestrated environment that follows Uncle Bob's approach to data development: "Go slow to go fast." Pipefitter comes with developer-specific tools, like linters and Black, to streamline development, as well as simple access to the underlying container environment via a well-documented and straightforward Docker Compose implementation.

## Features

- Orchestration using Airflow for smooth and efficient pipeline management
- PyTorch integration for advanced machine learning model development
- MLOps tools for seamless model deployment, monitoring, and maintenance
- Jupyter Notebook and VSCode integration for convenient development and collaboration
- Pre-configured development tools, including linters and Black, for a standardized and streamlined development process
- Easy access to the container environment via Docker Compose

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. If not, follow the installation guides for [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. **Clone the repository**: Clone the Pipefitter repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Pipefitter.git
   ```

3. **Build and run the Docker Compose environment**: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the tools**: Open your web browser and navigate to the respective URLs for the different tools in the framework (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Airflow). You can find the URLs and access credentials in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
